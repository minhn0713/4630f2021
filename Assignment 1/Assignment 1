Assignment 1

1/ There are some ideas such as working online, and sports betting online. The problem with working online apps/websites is the payout, they took so much fees, my idea for this problem is that the dev should lower the fees rate then it will attract more users. 
The problem with sports betting online is that the payout process takes so long and limited payout options (only BTC and cash), my idea for this problem is that the dev should allow more payout options such as check (lower the fee), bank, and make it faster payout. 

2/ In my opinion, there are some ways to compensate the developers such as selling virtual items in-app (optional), like in-app purchases even though the app is totally free. 
Selling virtual items is completely optional, the users can have their choice to buy it or not, that money will go toward the developers. Moreover, if they have a large user base then the developers will get paid based on the number of downloads in Appstore/Playstore.

3/ In my opinion, Facebook has the best UI design. Its layout and UI design are very neat and organized. There are a lot of functionalities that we can choose and explore, all of them are very useful.

4/ To be honest, their reports are nice and have some interesting ideas, but I have my own idea to pursue as a project for this course, and number 2 got me closer to it. 
My project for this course would be completely free for the users and I will make an attractive UI to attract more users.
