Project Title: New World

Description: This app we are building will gather news around the globe using NewsAPI and display it
through the app for our users to read. The user can have choose which kind of news they want to read
based on the categories listed on the app such as Sports news, Tech news, Business news, etc. Moreover,
after reading any specific article, the user can then like/dislike an article and/or comment on that
article and also share the article to their friends and family. In order to share the article, they
have to either connect a social media account to our app, or they can create an account in our app.
Lastly, we will have a chatting feature for our users to connect with their fellow news readers, they
can chat, share articles, share pictures just like any other social media apps.

For now, we have 6 main layouts and many different small layouts for each main layouts. We will add
more layouts here as we go.

_Chatting screen: This is the screen where users can chat with their friends.
_Settings screen: This is the screen where users can change the app's layout based on their liking. We
